This folder contains Inkscape extensions, i.e. the scripts
that implement some commands that you can use from within 
Inkscape. Most of these commands are in the Effects menu.

Each *.inx file describes an extension,
listing its name, purpose, prerequisites, etc. These
files are read by Inkscape on launch. Other files are
the scripts themselves (Perl, Python, and Ruby are 
supported, as well as shell scripts).
