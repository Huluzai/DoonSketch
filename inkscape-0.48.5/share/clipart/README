This directory is for the official Inkscape-related clipart:
Inkscape logo, banners, promotional graphics, etc.

This is not for general-purpose SVG clipart. For that, there are
several excellent sources:

http://openclipart.org has thousands of public domain clipart images
in SVG

http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG has thousands of free
encyclopedic images in SVG, many of them usable as clipart (maps,
flags, diagrams, coats of arms, etc.)
