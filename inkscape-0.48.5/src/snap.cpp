 * to snap. If we'd snap an unaligned node to the grid, previously aligned nodes would

 * between the source and its pasted copy is a multiple of the grid pitch. If the source
 * was aligned, then the copy will therefore also be aligned.
 *
 * PS: Whether we really find a multiple also depends on the snapping range! Most users
 * will have "always snap" enabled though, in which case a multiple will always be found.
 * PS2: When multiple grids are present then the result will become ambiguous. There is no
